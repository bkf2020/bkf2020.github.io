					Did a prefix sum solution by finding the

					Got seg fault probably because the stack size is too small?
					I changed from using arrays to vector and it worked fine...

					The answer to this problem was 2 to the power of the
					number of connected components. I output zero if
					there is an edge from cows u to v that requires u and v
					to have DIFFERENT colors and the SAME color. However,
					there could be a cycle which also makes the answer zero.
					So, I needed to try to paint the cows and see if there
					were any contradictions.

					<p>
					The first solution I had was testing if a path between any two
					cows existed. After knowing this was a floodfill problem, I realized
					that I could just find which cows a cow can visit.
					</p>
					<p>
					However, I also misread the problem and didn't realize the roads
					were between ADJACENT cows. Furthermore, I didn't realize there
					could be MULTIPLE roads in each row or column. I thought there was
					at most one road for each row or column.

					Solved by using prefix and suffix sums.
					In the prefix sums, I found the cost
					from the beginning up to index i, and in
					the suffix sums, I found the cost from the
					end to index i. If we saw a color earlier,
					then we do not need to use another stroke
					as long as there IS NOT a smaller color in
					the way.

				<th class="so">Solved</th>
				<th>
					I basically reimplemented the USACO solution.
					That solution uses a queue for each cow we add.
					For each cow we add, we check if it has 3 adjacent cows
					and add a cow as necessary. We also check each of its
					adjacent cows to see if more cows need to be added.

					I thought in the most extreme case,
					the cows would be a diamond centered
					at the origin, but it should be a diamond centered
					at (500, 500).

					I thought of computing the number of subgrids
					where every cell is at least 100 and the number
					of subgrids where every cell is at least 101.
					However, I didn't know how to compute these numbers.
					To do this, you consider the subgrids that start at row i
					and row j. You check each column between rows i and j to see
					if each value is at least 100 or 101.
					A group of x consecutive columns contributes x * (x + 1) / 2
					subgrids to the answer.

				<th>
					As given in the problem input, p[i] is the ith cow.
					I let i &rarr; p[i] be an edge. Then, the permutation
					is a graph made up of multiple cycles that are unconnected.
					Then, I binary searched on the answer. From the swaps,
					I made a graph where a[i] &rarr; b[i] was an edge if w[i] is larger than or equal to the answer we are
					checking. This was an UNDIRECTED graph, and I FORGOT to add b[i] &rarr; a[i] as an edge.
					To find the answer, I found the component each node was in in the undirected graph created
					by the edges a[i] &rarr; b[i] for 1 &le; i &le; M.
					Each node in a cycle must have the same component.

					Page 71 of the pdf of the

					Basically, if you have a task with duration a BEFORE

					tasks allows us to loose b points (from the longer task)
					and gain a points (from the shorter task).
