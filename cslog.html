			These are computer science problems I am trying out this week.

			of the problems (as of Jan 02, 2022). This starts the week of Jan 03, 2022
			to Jan 09, 2022. It's okay if I don't solve all the problems.

					Took a while to come up with a solution for this problem.
					First, I use Floyd-Warshall to find the minimum cost to change
					from button i to button j. Then, I found the minimum cost
					of changing the first i buttons in the combo to a letter j.
					After that, I let <code>dp[i]</code> be the minimum cost for the first
					i letters. The equation was
					<code>dp[i] = min(dp[i - K] + cost, dp[i - K - 1] + cost, dp[i - K - 2] + cost, ...)</code>.
					Here, <code>cost</code> represents the cost to change the last letters.
					This is O(NK) and is therefore too slow.

					I originally thought of using dijsktra, but I only moved to the 4 adjacent cells.
					This solution failed on the sample test case. I didn't realize that the proper solution
					was to move "3 moves" at a time. (One move is moving from a cell to its 4 adjacent cells.)
					Note that by moving "3 moves" at a time, it is possible to move from a cell to its adjacent cell.
					We move 3 moves at a time because Bessie eats every 3 fields she visits.
					If the distance to the end is less than two, Bessie doesn't need to eat again, so we

					I believe if <code>dp[k]</code> can get updated by a cow with weight w,
