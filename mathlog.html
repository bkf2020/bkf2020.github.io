		<p>
			These are math problems I am trying out this week.
			I'll include notes. My goal is to seriously attempt/solve ALL
			of the problems (as of Jan 02, 2022). This starts the week of
			Jan 03, 2022 to Jan 09, 2022. It's fine if I can't solve all the problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Possible status for each problem:
			<mark class="ns">Not started</mark>,
			<mark class="s">Started</mark>,
			<mark class="sa">Attempted Seriously</mark>,
			<mark class="so">Solved</mark>

						My solution let P<sub>i, T</sub> be the probability of getting
						the desired result if the ant is at a vertex of the top face
						after i moves AND i - 1 moves. Similarly, let P<sub>i, B</sub>
						be the probability of getting the desired result if the ant
						is at a vertex of the bottom face after i moves AND i - 1 moves.
					</p>
					<p>
						This meant P<sub>i, T</sub> = &frac12; P<sub>i + 1, T</sub> + &frac12; P<sub>i + 2, B</sub>,
						because the ant can either stay on the top face, or it moves to the bottom face and stays
						at the bottom face for an additional move.
						Similarly, P<sub>i, B</sub> = &frac12; P<sub>i + 1, B</sub> + &frac12; P<sub>i + 2, T</sub>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using this, I calculated the values of P<sub>i,B</sub> and P<sub>i,T</sub> for
						1 &le; i &le; 8. Note P<sub>8, B</sub> = 0 and P<sub>8, T</sub> = 1.
					</p>
					<p>
						The answer was 2/3 * P<sub>1, B</sub> + 1/3 * P<sub>2, T</sub>, but I got
						1/2 * P<sub>1, B</sub> + 1/2 * P<sub>2, T</sub>, since I thought the ant
						only had 2 moves when it started, but it actually has 3 moves.
					</p>
					<p>
						I realized that P<sub>i, T</sub> + P<sub>i, B</sub> = 1 and this can be
						proved using recursion. This may motivate the idea behind
						<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_8#Solution_3_.28Faster_Recursion.29">

						<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_8#Solution_3_.28Faster_Recursion.29">
							That solution</a> is pretty similar to the solution I outlined here.

						First, I was skeptical that ABA<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>
						was a convex quadrilateral. However, let the intersection
						of AC and BD be E. Then, angle AEB is (arc AB + arc CD) / 2
						while angle BEC is (arc BC + arc AD) / 2.
						Arc AB is less than arc BC, and arc CD is less than arc AD
						as AB &lt; BC and CD &lt; AD. This means angle AEB is less
						than angle BEC. That makes angle AEB acute, and it seems arc AD is less than 180,
						so triangle AEB is also acute.
						As a result, ABA<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub> is a convex quadrilateral.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the future, I should draw the circle first and then draw ABCD.
					</p>
					<p>
						After that, I wasn't so sure on where to continue, so I
						looked at
						<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_11#Solution_1_.28Cyclic_Quadrilaterals.2C_Similar_Triangles.2C_and_Trigonometry.29">Solution 1</a>
						and 
						<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_11#Solution_1.1_.28Law_of_Cosines.29">Solution 1.1</a>.
						I didn't know how to come up with such a solution, so I tried coming up with my own solution.
						I did some angle chasing and got where you would come up with solution 1. The mistake I made
						was getting triangle EC<sub>1</sub>D<sub>1</sub> similiar to triangle EDC instead of
						triangle EC<sub>1</sub>D<sub>1</sub> similiar to triangle ECD.
						Then, I understood where you would come up with solution 1.1 by eliminating
						A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, and D<sub>1</sub> and trying law of cosines
						since the absolute values of the cosines of angles AEB, BEC, CED, and AED are the same.

					Once picking the crop in the top left square,

					Using a hint from someone, I found a1 &#62; a2 &#60; a3 &#62; a4 &#60; a5 or a1 &#60; a2 &#62; a3 &#60; a4 &#62; a5.
					However, I got the wrong answer 24. In the first case, I thought that a1, a3, and a5 must be only 3, 4 or 5, and a2 and a4
					must be only 1 or 2. In the second case, I thought that a1, a3, and a5 must be only 1, 2, or 3, and a2 and a4 must be only
					4 or 5.

					Originally, I had the idea doing this problem by considering the probablility of
