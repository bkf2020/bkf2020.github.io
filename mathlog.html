		<p>
			These are math problems I am trying out this week.
			I'll include notes. My goal is to seriously attempt/solve ALL
			of the problems (as of Jan 02, 2022). This starts the week of
			Jan 03, 2022 to Jan 09, 2022. It's fine if I can't solve all the problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Possible status for each problem:
			<mark class="ns">Not started</mark>,
			<mark class="s">Started</mark>,
			<mark class="sa">Attempted Seriously</mark>,

					Let O be the center of the square with label 2000 and ABCD be the square with label 1099. Let P be
					the center of the square with label 200.
					Then one of these two cases can occur:
					<pre><code>
			P
	A--B
	|  |
	C--D
O
					</code></pre>
					<pre><code>
P
	A--B
	|  |
	C--D
		O
					</code></pre>
					In the first case, we need the slope of OP to be between the slopes of OA and OD in order for OP to intersect
					the square. Similarly, in the second case, we need the slope of OP to be between the slopes of OB and OC.
					This is one fact I noticed.
					</p>
					<p>
					Another fact I noticed was that ceil(1099/n) gave the row the square with label 1099 should be in,
					and this may be used with the first fact to calculate the slopes, but that would be very messy.
					Need to try more.

					I thought of <var>n</var> being the multiples of &phi;(3^3), &phi;(5^5), and &phi;(7^7).
					(See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function">Euler's Totient function</a>.)
					However, <var>n</var> can be smaller, as shown by manual calculation for 3^3.
					</p>
					<p>
					To find the value of <var>n</var> so 2^n was congruent to 149^n mod 3^3 = 27,
					I found the value of <var>n</var> so 2^n was congruent to 14^n mod 27.
					I then multiplied by the inverse of 2^n (since the inverse of 2 exists mod 27) to get
					7^n congruent to 1 mod 27. The smallest value of n should divide &phi;(3^3) = 18, and I found it to be 9.
					So n should be a multiple of 9.
					</p>
					<p>
					For 5^5 and 7^7, I thought of finding the inverses, but that isn't as easy.

					One mistake I made was believing EFI and IBC were congruent, but checking the wrong angles:

					One thing I learned from this problem was to consider the ratio of similar triangles as the ratio of heights

						My original solution  was wrong, because it assumed 4 would always have a modulo inverse
						mod <code>n + 5</code>, but this may not always be true.
						So, I glanced at
						<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2020_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_10#Solution_3_.28Official_MAA_1.29">
							MAA solution 1</a> and completed a similiar solution.
					</p>
					<p>
						But, this new approach was wrong because it forgot to test the values of n.
					
						Just because <code>n^2(n+1)^2</code> leaves a remainder of 68 mod <code>n + 5</code>
						does NOT mean <code>n^2(n+1)^2/4</code> leaves a remainder of 17 mod <code> n + 5</code>.
						Also, I forgot that we needed <code>n + 5 &gt; 17</code>,
						but this did not matter here, and checking the values of n would be an additional measure
						against this mistake.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, checking the values of n wasn't as tedious as it looked, but I should be careful here, since
						the computation isn't super trivial.
					</p>
					<p>
						Leaving it as 'started' because I could have thought more.

					<p>
					Avoided getting stuck on one approach for this problem.
					I believe I noticed that I wasn't using the fact that the entire
					P(x) polynomial was given, so I wrote
					<ul>
						<li><code>P(x) = x^2 - 3x - 7</code></li>
						<li><code>Q(x) = x^2 - ax + 2</code></li>
						<li><code>R(x) = x^2 - bx + c</code></li>
					</ul>
					and found the corresponding values of <code>P + Q</code>, <code>P + R</code>,
					and <code>Q + R</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Then, I used this fact from the problem:
					<ul>
						<li><code>P + Q = 2(x - p)(x - q)</code></li>
						<li><code>P + R = 2(x - p)(x - r)</code></li>
						<li><code>Q + R = 2(x - q)(x - r).</code></li>
					</ul>
					This is because pairs of <code>P + Q</code>, <code>P + R</code>,
					and <code>Q + R</code> share the same roots, but these common roots are distinct.
					</p>
					<p>
					After that, I found <code>p + q, pq, p + r, pr, q + r, qr</code> in terms of
					<code>a, b, c</code>, and so on...
					</p>
					<p>
					The resulting solution was similiar to <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2020_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_11#Solution_1">
						Solution 1 on the AoPS wiki</a>.

					Originally, I assumed that n and m just couldn't contain factors of 2, 3, 5, or 7.

					I checked the AoPS wiki solution and believe I got the hint for what went wrong
					simply by glancing over solution 1.
					Then, I fixed my solution by making m even: m = 2 * 143 = 286.

						My solution let P<sub>i, T</sub> be the probability of getting
						the desired result if the ant is at a vertex of the top face
						after i moves AND i - 1 moves. Similarly, let P<sub>i, B</sub>
						be the probability of getting the desired result if the ant
						is at a vertex of the bottom face after i moves AND i - 1 moves.
					</p>
					<p>
						This meant P<sub>i, T</sub> = &frac12; P<sub>i + 1, T</sub> + &frac12; P<sub>i + 2, B</sub>,
						because the ant can either stay on the top face, or it moves to the bottom face and stays
						at the bottom face for an additional move.
						Similarly, P<sub>i, B</sub> = &frac12; P<sub>i + 1, B</sub> + &frac12; P<sub>i + 2, T</sub>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using this, I calculated the values of P<sub>i,B</sub> and P<sub>i,T</sub> for
						1 &le; i &le; 8. Note P<sub>8, B</sub> = 0 and P<sub>8, T</sub> = 1.
					</p>
					<p>
						The answer was 2/3 * P<sub>1, B</sub> + 1/3 * P<sub>2, T</sub>, but I got
						1/2 * P<sub>1, B</sub> + 1/2 * P<sub>2, T</sub>, since I thought the ant
						only had 2 moves when it started, but it actually has 3 moves.
					</p>
					<p>
						I realized that P<sub>i, T</sub> + P<sub>i, B</sub> = 1 and this can be
						proved using recursion. This may motivate the idea behind

						First, I was skeptical that ABA<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>
						was a convex quadrilateral. However, let the intersection
						of AC and BD be E. Then, angle AEB is (arc AB + arc CD) / 2
						while angle BEC is (arc BC + arc AD) / 2.
						Arc AB is less than arc BC, and arc CD is less than arc AD
						as AB &lt; BC and CD &lt; AD. This means angle AEB is less
						than angle BEC. That makes angle AEB acute, and it seems arc AD is less than 180,
						so triangle AEB is also acute.
						As a result, ABA<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub> is a convex quadrilateral.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the future, I should draw the circle first and then draw ABCD.
					</p>
					<p>
						After that, I wasn't so sure on where to continue, so I
						looked at
						<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_11#Solution_1_.28Cyclic_Quadrilaterals.2C_Similar_Triangles.2C_and_Trigonometry.29">Solution 1</a>
						and 
						<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2021_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_11#Solution_1.1_.28Law_of_Cosines.29">Solution 1.1</a>.
						I didn't know how to come up with such a solution, so I tried coming up with my own solution.
						I did some angle chasing and got where you would come up with solution 1. The mistake I made
						was getting triangle EC<sub>1</sub>D<sub>1</sub> similiar to triangle EDC instead of
						triangle EC<sub>1</sub>D<sub>1</sub> similiar to triangle ECD.
						Then, I understood where you would come up with solution 1.1 by eliminating
						A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, and D<sub>1</sub> and trying law of cosines
						since the absolute values of the cosines of angles AEB, BEC, CED, and AED are the same.

					the positions for the bin with 5 balls and the bin with 4 balls
					and the order matters.

					Using a hint from someone, I found a1 &#62; a2 &#60; a3 &#62; a4 &#60; a5 or a1 &#60; a2 &#62; a3 &#60; a4 &#62; a5.
					However, I got the wrong answer 24. In the first case, I thought that a1, a3, and a5 must be only 3, 4 or 5, and a2 and a4
					must be only 1 or 2. In the second case, I thought that a1, a3, and a5 must be only 1, 2, or 3, and a2 and a4 must be only
					4 or 5.
					</p>
					<p>
					However, I did not consider in the first case, a1 = 2, a2 = 1 OR a4 = 1, a5 = 2.
					In the second case, a1 = 4, a2 = 5 OR a4 = 5, a5 = 4.
					This adds 8 possible cases.

					Originally, I had the idea doing this problem by considering the probablility of
					getting the 2019 ring (where everyone gets $1) from certain states and a certain number of moves.
					The two states were 1-1-1 or 2-1-0. Reordering is included.
					When I tried getting the correct solution (#4 on AoPS wiki), I forgot to make sure
					all possible ways to transfer money were considered.
