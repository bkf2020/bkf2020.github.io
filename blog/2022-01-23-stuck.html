		<p><b>Published on Jan 23, 2022. Last updated on Jan 23, 2022</b></p>
		<p>
			I've made a couple projects and put the source code up on
			<a href="https://github.com/bkf2020">Github</a>,
			<a href="https://gitlab.com/bkf2020">Gitlab</a>, and
			<a href="https://codeberg.org/bkf2020">Codeberg</a>. You
			can view all of them on the <a href="/">home of this website</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've always thought it would be nice to maintain an open
			source project for a couple of months, but I am unable
			to come up with anything of such type. Anything I come up with
			will probably take a couple hours at most. I think I don't have
			enough experience to make something that takes a couple of months
			to build.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, I think I made a couple useful things. They are
			small, but hopefully useful. Some of them are include
			<a href="/mwe">MWE: make work easier</a> and
			<a href="https://codeberg.org/bkf2020/liblock">liblock</a>.
			I guess most of the things I've written are web-based, probably
			to cater to as many people as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the future, I would probably like to write some
			posts on the blog. In the mean time, I do update these logs:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/mathlog">Math log</a></li>
				<li><a href="/cslog">Computer Science Log</a></li>
				<li><a href="/fitlog">Fitness Log</a></li>
			</ul>
			I enjoy problem solving and I also want to exercise.
		</p>
		<p>
			To conclude, to make the blog writting experience more
			enjoyable, I should create a simple shell script
			<code>create.sh</code> that allows me to create a blog
			entry. I like writing blogs in HTML because it has more features
			than something like Markdown, so I'm thinking <code>create.sh</code>
			just copies the contents of <code>template.html</code>
			(find it in <code>blog/template.html</code> in the
			<a href="https://codeberg.org/bkf2020/pages">Website repo</a>)
			and changes the name. It has to update the title of the article
			in two places, and it also has to update the entry list
			for the blog.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, one problem with this is that the reader should
			see when a post gets published and updated. I currently
			am going to have to update the date the post gets updated,
			but can automate the date the post gets published. I think there
			exists a simple HTML blogging solution and I should check it out.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've just started out writing blogs, and I think I'll write
			better content in the future. For now, that's it! See you
			next time, whenever that is... :)
